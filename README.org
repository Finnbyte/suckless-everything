#+TITLE: Suckless Everything
#+AUTHOR: Finnbyte

My dotfiles for the most important suckless software for my workflow

* Software included
- dwm - dynamic window manager
- dwmblocks - Improve dwm's bar
- floating-dwm - dwm but made to be a floating wm (WIP)
- st - suckless terminal emulator
- surf - suckless web browser
- nsxiv - simple image viewer, and a fork of now unmaintained sxiv
- sfm - simple file manager (which I sometimes use)
  
* Note about TUI file managers
There are or /will/ multiple TUI file managers in this repo, and I am not sure which of them to use daily.
I've been trying out multiple different, in both *philosophy* and *functionality*, file managers but it will take
some time to understand which of them suits my needs best.

I'll have all the ones I like the most in this repo.
